# OptimumThreshold_ROC
Here we will be firstly analysing the how different threshold values effect the area under the Curve in a Receiver Operating charcteristic(ROC) curve. And at last we will show how to define a function in python to calculate the most optimal threshold value for the logistic Regression.
